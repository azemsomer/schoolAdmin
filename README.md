# schoolAdmin

This repository will contain a RDMS of a high school administration. As this project is based on the Dutch education system, all further documentation will only be available in Dutch.

First of all, the repository contains a datamodel, created by using the entity-relationship model - as developed by Peter Chen. Secondly, a database design is derived from the datamodel.

As this project is a work in progress, this repository will be updated when there are new developments.
